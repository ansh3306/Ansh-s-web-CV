          HI! I am Ansh. I am a passionate and curious student pursuing a Master's degree in <b>Mathematics</b> with a <b>minor in Computer Science</b>. Currently <b>self-studying quantum computing</b>, I am deeply interested in the intersection of mathematical structures, quantum theory, and computational methods. My academic journey has equipped me with strong foundations in linear algebra, abstract algebra, and algorithms, which I actively apply in exploring quantum algorithms and quantum information theory.<br /><br />


          I am particularly driven by the challenge of building intuition for quantum phenomena through rigorous mathematics and computational experimentation. I am currently attending Qiskit Global Summer School 2025(QGSS2025), and I am eager to contribute to projects that push the boundaries of quantum technology.<br /><br />


          Beyond academics, I am enthusiastic about calisthenics and pretty much anything that keeps me moving and help me cultivate discipline and resilience â€” qualities I bring into my problem-solving approach.
